# Project Title: Classification of Chest Radiographs using Deep Transfer Learning

### Brief One Line Summary
A deep learning model using a pre-trained ResNet and transfer learning to accurately classify diseases from chest X-ray images.

### Overview
Deep learning is a superior method for image-based disease classification, with models outperforming human experts in tasks like skin cancer detection. This project builds a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automate the analysis of chest X-rays. Using a pre-trained ResNet and transfer learning, we create a fast and accurate model to address a critical need in healthcare.

### Problem Statement
A Toronto hospital requires an automated system to classify chest diseases from X-rays in under a minute, aiming to reduce diagnostic time and cost.

### Dataset
This project uses a dataset of 133 chest X-ray images categorized into four classes:
* Healthy 
* Covid-19 
* Bacterial Pneumonia 
* Viral Pneumonia

### Tools and Technologies
* **Python**
* **Keras API**
* **ResNet (Residual Network)** 
* **Pandas & Matplotlib**
* **Colab Notebook**

### Methods
1.  **Model Selection**: We use **ResNet**, a state-of-the-art CNN with "skip connections" to prevent vanishing gradients in deep networks. ResNet has achieved super-human performance with a 3.57% error rate on ImageNet[cite: 32].

2.  **Transfer Learning**: We use **transfer learning**, a technique where a pre-trained model is repurposed for a new task. This significantly reduces training time and enables high performance even with a small dataset[cite: 43, 69].

3.  **Model Adaptation**: The base model's pre-trained convolutional layers are frozen. ]New dense layers are added for our specific classification task and are the only layers trained.

### Key Insights
* Transfer learning enables the development of accurate models even with small datasets].
* Reusing a pre-trained model like ResNet drastically reduces training time and computational costs
* This project proves the feasibility of using AI to build practical tools that can augment healthcare diagnostics.

### Results & Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates an efficient workflow for building an automated medical imaging classifier. The resulting model serves as a powerful proof-of-concept for using deep learning to enable faster, data-driven diagnostic support in hospitals.
